          ## Coverage Configuration Fix Applied
          **CRITICAL FIX:** Changed from \`sonar.dart.coverage.reportPaths\` to \`sonar.dart.lcov.reportPaths\`
          
          According to official SonarCloud documentation:
          - ✅ Using correct parameter: \`sonar.dart.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info\`
          - ✅ This should resolve the 0% coverage issue
